**WordFlow** is a minimalist, browser-based utility designed to generate random English text strings instantly. It serves as a modern, readable alternative to traditional "Lorem Ipsum" generators, wrapped in a sleek, developer-friendly dark interface.

📖 What is it?
WordFlow is a lightweight, single-page application built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to input a specific number and instantly receive a randomized flow of words from a curated library of 200 English nouns.

✨ Why use it?
Natural Placeholders: Uses recognizable words (like mountain, bridge, galaxy) instead of Latin, making your UI mockups look more natural.

Instant "Click-to-Copy": Simply click on the generated text to copy it to your clipboard. The interface clears automatically, ready for your next request.

Performance Driven: Zero external dependencies or frameworks. It’s a single-file tool that runs lightning-fast in any browser.

Dark Mode UI: Designed with a high-contrast theme (Yellow on Charcoal) to reduce eye strain during late-night development sessions.
